Small feature app: Image to text -> Translation


We want to make a module that can translate anything and everything and store it back into the original format. This is an initiative in order to decrease the struggle of information retrieval and access mainly to decrease the restrictions when it comes to opportunities. Opportunities are powerful and they can help a person in gaining perspective and grow. Hence, focusing on things that are actually important rather than struggling to gain access to the information.
